/// This struct is used to cache those interactively built offers, and should be passed into

///
/// ## Lifecycle of a cached offer
///
/// 1. On initial startup, recipients will request offer paths from the static invoice server in a burst on
///    each timer tick
/// 2. Once offer paths are received, recipients will build offers and corresponding static
///    invoices, cache the offers as `OfferStatus::Pending`, and send the invoices to the server for
///    persistence
/// 3. While the invoices remain unconfirmed as persisted by the server, the recipient will send a
///    fresh invoice corresponding each pending offer to the server on each timer tick
/// 4. Once an invoice is confirmed as persisted by the server, the recipient will mark the
///    corresponding offer as ready to receive payments (`OfferStatus::Ready`)
/// 5. If a ready-to-receive offer gets returned to the user, the cache will mark that offer as
///    `OfferStatus::Used` and attempt to update the server-persisted invoice corresponding to that
///    offer once per timer tick until the offer expires
/// 6. If a ready-to-receive offer in the cache is several hours old and has not yet been seen by
///    the user, the cache will interactively build a new replacement offer and send the
///    corresponding invoice to the server. This way the cache tries to always have a fresh unused
///    offer ready to go.
